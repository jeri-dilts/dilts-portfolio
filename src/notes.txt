In no particular order...things to work on, because nothing in ever truly done



- make my README have a little more context - super borning right?
- 'Welcome' text doesn't highlight on mobile. -- need fixing
- put all projects into Air Table and connect via axios
- Use 'map' when rendering all those icons in the about screen
- get tool tip feature on about screen
- fix icons on portfolio page - just tidier, maybe adjust the color
- get rid of linkedin and github icons -instead make links in about me description



- fix all px and em --- inconsistencies (not sure why this bothers me)
- Design for ipads - https://codeconvey.com/responsive-media-queries-for-all-devices/
- Should I think about portait and landscape view on mobile?
- Just a reminder to check on the Thank You submission screen. I keep forgetting about it.
- maybe add an animated hamburger? - https://hamburger-react.netlify.app/
- or build a hamburger from scratch ... saw a tutorial on youtube with animations
