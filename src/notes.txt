// Trying the hamburger menu to conditionally render upon
// screen width changing

@jeri did you figure it out? I've done it a couple times now 
from scratch using an event listener to listen to screen width 
changes and state, I copy the code every time lol. I also added 
CSS transition group for my portfolio one
-- I feel like useEffect would be needed for everytime the screen changes the state
would need to be changed.

- transfer all GA materials to my personal github and make them private
- go over ReactJS lectures again to really nail down useEffect, state, hooks, etc
